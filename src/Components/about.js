        Hi. My name is Robert and I am a front end javascript developer,
        specializing in writing clean, maintainable code. Before beginning my
        career as a developer, I worked as a location manager and scout in the
        film industry. In that job communication, creativity and attention to
        detail were the lynchpins of carrying out successful projects I and
        enjoy bringing those skills to bear in collaborative projects and dev
        teams.
