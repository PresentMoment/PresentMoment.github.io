        I'm Robert, a front end javascript developer focusing on the React
        ecosystem. Before beginning my career as a developer, I worked as a
        location manager and scout in the film industry. In that job
        communication was the lynchpin of a success. I believe communication is
        still paramount in my current field, both within dev teams and in the
        writing of clean, readable code. Click around to see what I've been up
        to, and how to contact me.
